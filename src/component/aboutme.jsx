                                <p>Someone who likes creating interfaces with a modern and futuristic appearance based on websites. I like creating designs, drawings and programs. So, I chose to pursue an opportunity to experience website design and interface programming.<br/>
                                <br/>In my opinion, seeking experience is important for a person's future career because from these experiences, we can know how to face, change and overcome a problem. I really want to join Cretivox because I want to try a more productive 
                                and relevant world of work. seeing the huge influence, popularity and interest, I think Cretivox is the right place for me to gain knowledge and be creative
                                Therefore, I want to introduce the world of work through the Internship Season 2 opportunity at Cretivox. I don't have a lot of experience and portfolio, but with my willingness to keep learning and being willing to try things I can't yet, I'm sure I can give my best.</p>
